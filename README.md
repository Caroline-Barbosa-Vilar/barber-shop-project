# The Barber's Shop Project

This is my first project (my first contact with web development) created during a frontend course of "HTML5 e CSS3" at Alura's plataform. 
In this classes I learned the basics of HTML5 and CSS3 and their properties, atributes, different uses and how to create a simple website.
